## When On High

> enuma eliš lā nābu šamāmu
- šapliš ammatum šuma lā zakrat

> When on high, the heavens had not been named
- When the earth below had not been called out by name


Notes: What is the focus? What is the beginning of the narrative? In the ancient near east they didn't think as much about the material, they were more interested in the purpose; the way the thing could be used.

> Ea his father begat him,
- Damkina his mother bore him.
His figure was well developed, the glance of his eyes was dazzling,
- His growth was manly, he was might from the beginning.
Four were his eyes, four his ears,
- Flame shot forth as he moved his lips.
His four ears grew large,
- And his eyes likewise took in everything
